Greg Shaddix has been called our generation’s equivalent to Andy Griffith with just a touch of Mark Twain sprinkled in. Greg’s wit and down-home wisdom have entertained audiences of all sizes for over twenty years.  With life experiences as a boat captain to “pushing cows where they did not want to go” as a cowboy on a 186,000 acre ranch, Greg brings his audiences into his quirky and fantastical world where his storytelling leaves the listener wondering how much is fact and how much is fiction.
